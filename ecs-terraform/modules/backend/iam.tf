# Two distinct, least-privilege IAM roles back the ECS Fargate task (R6.1):
#   - Execution_Role: assumed by the ECS agent to pull the image from ECR and write
#     container logs to CloudWatch. Uses the AWS-managed execution policy only (R6.2).
#   - Task_Role: assumed by the running application container to call DynamoDB with
#     exactly the four actions the 16 access patterns require, scoped to the App_Table
#     and its indexes (R5, R6.3).
#
# No IAM user and no long-lived access key are created; the ECS service principal
# assumes these roles via STS at task start, so no AWS credentials are embedded
# anywhere (R6.4). Trust is restricted to the ECS task service principal only (R6.5).

# Trust policy shared by both roles: only the ECS task runtime principal may assume
# them via sts:AssumeRole. Scoping the principal to ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com keeps the
# roles unusable by any other service or account (R6.5).
