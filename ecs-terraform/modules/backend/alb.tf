# Backend-owned security groups for the internal ALB and the ECS tasks.
# 01-network exposes no security groups, so the backend owns ALB_SG and ECS_SG.
#
# Traffic path: CloudFront -> VPC Origin -> internal ALB (ALB_SG) -> ECS tasks (ECS_SG).
# Ingress is never opened to 0.0.0.0/0 (aws-security steering): the ALB accepts
# traffic only from the AWS-managed CloudFront origin-facing prefix list, and the
# ECS tasks accept traffic only from the ALB security group (SG-to-SG).
#
# The ALB, target group, and listener are appended to this file by later tasks (5.2, 5.3).

# AWS-managed prefix list of the CloudFront origin-facing IP ranges. Used as the ALB
# ingress source so only CloudFront (via the VPC Origin) can reach the internal ALB,
# rather than opening the listener to the whole VPC or the internet.
